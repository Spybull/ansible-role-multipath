# /etc/multipath.conf - is the configuration file for the multipath daemon.
# It is used to overwrite the built-in configuration table of multipathd.
# Any line whose first non-white-space character is a '#' is considered a comment line.
# Empty lines are ignored.

# Additional configuration can be made in drop-in files under /etc/multipath/conf.d.
# Files ending in .conf in this directory are read in alphabetical order,  after reading  /etc/multipath.conf.
# They use the same syntax as /etc/multipath.conf itself, and support all sections and keywords.
# If a keyword occurs in the same section in multiple files, the last occurrence will take precedence over all others.
